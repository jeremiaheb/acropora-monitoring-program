The Acropora Monitoring Program (AMP) is a monitoring program that
focuses on Acropora palmata populations throughout the U.S. Virgin
Islands. This program was originally established by Dr. Tyler Smith in
2011 and ran through 2013 (The report from this monitoring effort can be
located in the publications section). In 2020, AMP was re- established
by Dr. Marilyn Brandt and assesses A. palmata populations at nine sites
across the territory. Each site has 3 permanent radial plots, each 7m in
radius. Assessments are completed on a biannual to annual basis and
focus on the size, health, and density of the A. palmata colonies within
the plots.
